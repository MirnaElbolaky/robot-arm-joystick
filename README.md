# 🤖 Joystick-Controlled Robotic Arm

This project demonstrates how to build and control a robotic arm using a joystick and Arduino. The arm moves in X and Y directions using stepper motors and has a gripper controlled by a servo motor.

## 🔧 Features

- Two-axis movement (X, Y) using joystick input
- Gripper opens/closes using joystick button
- Manual control system with smooth motion
- Built with Arduino Uno, SG90 servo, and ULN2003 drivers

## 🎮 Components Used

- Arduino Uno
- 2x 28BYJ-48 Stepper Motors
- 2x ULN2003 Driver Boards
- SG90 Mini Servo Motor
- Joystick Module
- Breadboard + Wires
- Power Supply (Batteries)

## 💻 Code

See the `arm_robot.ino` file for full implementation.
